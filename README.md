**Shoddy JAI API Manager**

Enhance your JanitorAI chat experience with custom presets! Quickly inject your favorite prompts, models, proxy URLs, and API keys directly into the chat modal using convenient buttons and dropdowns.

**Key Features:**

* **Custom Preset Buttons:** Create and save full chat setups (including prompt, model, proxy, and API key) and inject them with a single click from new buttons appearing in the JanitorAI chat modal.
* **Dynamic Dropdowns:** Access your saved prompts, models, proxy URLs, and API keys via intuitive dropdown menus directly within the JanitorAI modal for quick selection and insertion.
* **Comprehensive Data Management:**
    * **Save & Organize Prompts:** Store your most used custom prompts with descriptive names.
    * **Manage Models:** Keep a list of your preferred models for easy switching.
    * **Store Proxy URLs:** Quickly apply different proxy configurations.
    * **Local API Key Storage:** Save and select your API keys by name.
* **Edit & Delete Functionality:** Easily modify or remove any saved entries directly from the extension's compact, dark-mode friendly popup.
* **Seamless Integration:** Designed to blend visually with the JanitorAI interface, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**How It Works:**

1.  **Open the Extension Popup:** Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2.  **Add Your Data:** Use the intuitive forms to add new prompts, models, proxy URLs, or API keys.
3.  **Create Presets:** Combine your saved data into powerful "Presets" for one-click setup.
4.  **Use in JanitorAI:** When the JanitorAI chat modal appears, you'll see your custom buttons and dropdowns, ready to inject your saved configurations.

**Installation**
1. Click the green *Code* button and choose *Download ZIP*.
2. Open your browser and go to its extensions page. You can also just type *chrome://extensions/* in the address bar.
    * If you're using Edge, Opera, Firefox, or a similar browser, it will automatically take you to the right place, even if it says "chrome" in the URL.
3. Turn on *Developer mode*. This is needed because you're installing the extension manually. If you're using Firefox, you can skip this step as there isn't any modes you need to enable.
4. Install the extension.
    * **Chrome, Edge, Opera:** After enabling *Developer mode*, you'll see three options. Click *Load unpacked*. If you downloaded the ZIP file in step one, unzip it first. Most modern systems can do this without extra software, but you can use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) if needed. Make sure all the files are in their own folder after unzipping, then select that folder.
    * **Firefox:** Click the cog icon on the right side of the header at the top of the screen (not the one in the bottom-left labeled "Firefox settings"). From the dropdown, choose *Install Add-on From File*. 
        * **If Firefox says the files are corrupt:** Open the ZIP and check if the extension files are inside a folder within the ZIP. If they are, extract everything, then select all the files (not the folder) and create a new ZIP. This way, opening the ZIP shows the files directly.
5. If you had Janitor AI open while installing the extension, refresh the page(s) (Ctrl + R) for it to work.

**Please Note:**

* **Content Visibility:** Nothing will appear in the JanitorAI modal (no dropdowns or custom buttons) until you have added at least one corresponding entry (e.g., a prompt, model, proxy URL, API key, or preset) via the extension's popup.
* **Button Location:** Your custom preset buttons will be found at the **bottom of the JanitorAI chat modal**, below the existing JanitorAI preset options.
